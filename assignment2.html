            This is a schematic diagram of the circuit I built and shows
            the 3 LEDs connected to the 3 different pins with a resistor
            of 220 ohms and a current output of 5V at the pins. The button
            has its own schematic towards the bottom and the RGB LED has
            its own schematic at the top of the image.
