            This is a schematic diagram of the circuit I built and shows
            the 3 LEDs connected to the 3 different pins with a resistor
            of 220 ohms and a current output of 5V at the pins. The button
            has its own schematic towards the bottom and the RGB LED has
            its own schematic at the top of the image.

            Here are some photos of the breadboard circuit where you can see all the<br>connections from different angles.

            Here are some calculations to figure out the resistance needed. Since it was<br>either 250 or 160 ohms,
            I decided to use the 220 ohm resistor for all since I didn't need them to be a specific brightness.
